'''Lets users identify repository paths by custom schemes like kiln://Project/Group/Repository.

This extensions knows how to expand Kiln repository paths from
kiln://Project/Group/Repository to
the full http://your.fogbugz.com/kiln/Repo/Project/Group/Repository,
so you only have to type
"hg pull kiln://Project/Group/Repository" at the command line.

This extensions works for pull, push, incoming, outgoing, and clone.

To specify the Kiln path prefix, add a [kiln_scheme] section to your hg config like so:
[kiln_scheme]
kiln = https://your.fogbugz.com/kiln/Repo

    if pre.endswith("/"):
        pre = pre[0:len(pre) - 1]
    if not suff.startswith("/"):
        suff = "/" + suff
    return pre + suff
